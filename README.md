# tab2wave
Hackathon project for a chrome extension that can record audio from a a tab and save it as a wave file.

Made this in an evening in 2016. You can test the extension here: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tab-2-wave/bcdgejaoddliioekfejdncehaahfkmjb

 grunt build - will build the extension in the "dist" directory.
